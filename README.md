# Data Science Project from Scratch
## Webscraper and ML price prediction of used Mercedes cars
 In this private project a complete data science pipeline is done from scratch with the following tasks:
 1. Data Collecting -- Creating my own dataset through webscraping many thousands of used Mercedes cars from mobile.de with selenium
 2. Data Cleaning/ Feature Engineering -- Creating new features out of raw data and prepare raw data for ML modeling
 3. EDA -- Explanatory Data Analysis of my collected data and findings
 4. ML Model Building -- Set up ML models for predicting the used car price with sk-learn and statsmodels

### 1. Data Collecting
