# Data Science Project from Scratch
## Collecting own Data with a Webscraper and implement ML price prediction of used Mercedes cars
 In this private project a complete data science pipeline is done from scratch with the following tasks:
 1. Data Collecting -- Creating my own dataset through webscraping many thousands of used Mercedes cars from mobile.de with selenium
 2. Data Cleaning/ Feature Engineering -- Creating new features out of raw data and prepare raw data for ML modeling
 3. EDA -- Explanatory Data Analysis of my collected data and findings
 4. ML Model Building -- Set up ML models for predicting the used car price with sk-learn and statsmodels

### 1. Data Collecting
The dataset was collected via webscraping the used-car selling site
[mobilde.de:](https://www.mobile.de)
specially for used Mercedes-Benz cars.
python package Selenium is used for collecting the data.

### 2. Data Cleaning/ Feature Engineering
